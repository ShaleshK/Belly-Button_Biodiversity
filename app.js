// create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.
// create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements using d3.csv
// * Include state abbreviations in the circles.
// * Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

// Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. 
// Animate the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes. 
// Do this for two risk factors for each axis. 
// Or, for an extreme challenge, create three for each axis.
// * Hint: Try binding all of the CSV data to your circles. 
// This will let you easily determine their x or y values when you click the labels.
// Use the `d3-tip.js` plugin developed by [Justin Palmer](https://github.com/Caged)
// â€”we've already included this plugin in your assignment directory. (Images/8-tooltip.gif)
// Check out [David Gotz's example](https://bl.ocks.org/davegotz/bd54b56723c154d25eedde6504d30ad7)
